    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Overview\n",
    "In this tutorial, we learned about the fundamental quantum gates like Pauli X and Hadamard, their roles in quantum computation, and the effects of qubit rotations around different axes. We explored how these gates form a universal set and delved into the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learnings\n",
    "- Pauli X and Hadamard Gates: These gates are essential for quantum computation. The Pauli X gate acts as a quantum NOT gate, flipping the state of a qubit. The Hadamard gate creates superpositions, transforming a basis state into an equal superposition of basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Qubit Rotations and Phases: This part explores how qubits can be rotated around different axes and how global phases affect qubit states, essential for understanding quantum gate operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rotations About X and Y Axes: Detailed explanation of how rotations around the X and Y axes affect the state of a qubit, altering its probability amplitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Universal Gate Sets: Discussion on how a set of gates can be combined to create any single-qubit gate, emphasizing the importance of certain gate sets in constructing complex quantum operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measurements: Insights into the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements, explaining how the act of measuring a qubit affects its state and the outcome probabilities.\n",
